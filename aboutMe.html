        <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>

        <p>My name is Eager Eagle and I am an incoming Product Management Intern at Eagle Co. Currently, I am pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science 
          at Brown University with a focus on Human Computer Interaction and Design. Before Brown I worked for 2 years at Eagle Tech as a Federal
          Systems Engineer working with clients the likes of NASA and the Department of Energy. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I was born and raised in the Washington, DC area and am a passionate DC sports fan! Outside of that I enjoy hiking, skiing, pickleball, honestly anything 
          that gives me an excuse to get outside.
